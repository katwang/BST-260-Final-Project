* removed zipcodes for US territories (zipcodes that weren't for the 50 states or DC)
* removed "zipcodes" that had length less than 5, ie zipcodes with characters and 3 digits


```{r}
library(zipcode)
data("zipcode")
dat_mu_zmerge <- dat_mu_zip %>% left_join(zipcode, by = c("ZIP" = "zip"))

#check that states match

test_mismatch <- dat_mu_zmerge %>% left_join(states, by = c("state" = "state_abb")) %>% mutate(Business_State_Territory = as.character(Business_State_Territory)) %>% filter(state_name != Business_State_Territory)

test_mismatch %>% filter(Business_State_Territory == "District of Columbia")

# percent mismatch state
nrow(test_mismatch)/nrow(dat_mu_zip)
nrow(test_mismatch)/nrow(dat_mu_zmerge)

# check which zips are mismatching
test_mismatch %>% 
  filter(Business_State_Territory != "District of Columbia") %>% 
  group_by(ZIP, Business_State_Territory, state_name) %>% 
  summarize(num = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(num)) %>% 
  head(8)

```
about 4% mismatch in zipcode/states
top 10 mismatches:
* zipcode 51503 is in Iowa (agrees with zipcode package)/bordering Nebraska, but reported as Nebraska which is neighboring Iowa. This may be correct, so we'll keep Nebraska as reported
* zipcode 55905 is in Minnesota, but reported state Florida is not near Minnesota. Since there is likely a typo in either zip or state, we'll remove this mismatched zip all together
* zipcode 54601 is in Wisconsin/bordering Minnesota, but reported as Minnesota which is neighboring Wisconsin. We'll keep Minnesota as reported
* zipcode 33331 is in Florida, which is nowhere near Ohio. Since it is unclear which was the typo, we'll delete all these mismatches
* zipcode 55905 is in Minnesota - found it's actually Mayo Clinic (along with #2). Wisconsin and Minnesota are bordering each other, so we'll keep Wisconsin


notes: 
running this code test_mismatch %>% filter(ZIP == "55905")
notice that this zipcode is incorrectly used for multiple states, possibly meaning there were data entry/quality issues
